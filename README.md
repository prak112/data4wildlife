# data4wildlife Hackathon
**Hackathon (29-30 Jan 2022) based on developing a digital solution to prevent illegal wildlife trade(IWT) on online social platforms.**

* Team - Sean Rogers, Gabriela 
* Mentor - Alastair Jamieson
* Challenge - to build a **benchmark dataset** of possible instances of different types of wildlife trafficking-related information, which could also be searched and analyzed. According to the guidelines - 
    * _A benchmark dataset is a public dataset which is designed and collected for studying real-world data science/research problems._ 
    * _The benchmark dataset should be social media platform agnostic, as wildlife is trafficking across multiple platforms such as Instagram and YouTube._
